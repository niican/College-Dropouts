This repository is a project for the Advanced Computer Programming course, where groups were formed to work on the midterm and final exams. In this case, we developed a simple Python-based application capable of scraping weather condition data from the website weather.com using a location point as input. The application is equipped with an interactive GUI and includes a feature to export the scraped data into a CSV file.
